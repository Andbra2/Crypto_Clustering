# Crypto Clustering

## Description

This project employs Python and unsupervised learning techniques to analyze the impact of 24-hour and 7-day price changes on cryptocurrencies. Through clustering, we aim to uncover patterns and relationships within the data that can provide insights into cryptocurrency market dynamics.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed, along with the necessary libraries specified in the requirements.txt file.
3. Open the Crypto_Clustering.ipynb notebook using Jupyter or any compatible environment.

## Usage

1. Data Loading: Load the cryptocurrency market data from crypto_market_data.csv into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Data Preparation: Normalize the data using StandardScaler to ensure uniformity and prepare it for clustering.
3. Finding Optimal K: Use the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters (k) for the dataset.
4. Clustering with K-Means: Cluster cryptocurrencies using the K-Means algorithm with the optimal k value obtained.
5. Optimizing Clusters with PCA: Utilize Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and improve clustering performance.
6. Visualizing Results: Visualize the clustering results using scatter plots to gain insights into cryptocurrency clusters.
